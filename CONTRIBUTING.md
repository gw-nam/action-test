# Contribution Guidelines
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
7. Once the pull request (PR) is submitted, the reviewer will review it. 
8. If there is any feedback, please update the PR to reflect the suggestions.
9. After the review is completed, the PR will be merged.

## Code Review Standards
We conduct code reviews based on the following standards to ensure that your contribution maintains consistency with the project and upholds quality:

1. Code Quality
  - Write code that is easy to read and maintain. Avoid overly complex logic, and if possible, suggest better solutions.
  - Minimize duplicated code and check if the code can be refactored into reusable modules.

2. Feature Verification
  - Test the new feature or bug fix to ensure it works as intended.
  - All tests must pass before submitting the PR. Include any additional necessary tests in the PR.

3. Code Style Compliance
  - Ensure that your code follows the project's code style. Feedback will be given if there are formatting issues or violations of naming conventions.

4. Meaningful Commit Messages
  - Ensure that commit messages clearly describe the changes made.
  - Avoid including too many modifications in a single commit. If possible, divide changes into smaller commits.

5. Documentation
  - If new features, APIs, or configuration changes are introduced, make sure to update or add relevant documentation.
  - Write appropriate comments in the code, especially for explaining complex logic.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
